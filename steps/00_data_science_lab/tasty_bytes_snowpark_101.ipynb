    "As Tasty Bytes Data Scientists, we have been asked to support this goal by helping our food truck drivers more intelligently pick where to park for shifts.<br>**We want to direct our trucks to locations that are expected to have the highest sales on a given shift. <br>This will maximize our daily revenue across our fleet of trucks.**\n",
